This directory contains Mermaid JS diagrams visualizing different aspects of the PaderbornJS Community Hub codebase.

## Viewing the Diagrams

These diagrams are written in Mermaid JS format in Markdown files. To view them:

1. Use GitHub's built-in Mermaid rendering in markdown files
2. Use a Markdown editor that supports Mermaid (like VS Code with Markdown Preview Mermaid extension)
3. Use the [Mermaid Live Editor](https://mermaid.live/) by copying the Mermaid code
4. Install a browser extension that renders Mermaid syntax

## Updating Diagrams

As the codebase evolves, please keep these diagrams updated to reflect the current architecture. Mermaid diagrams are easy to maintain as they are text-based and can be version-controlled like code.
